Kubernetes API is at the core of Kubernetes. It exposes a HTTP API server that let you manage your cluster without the need to use a CLI or a UI.

Basically, the API helps administrators and developers manager their Kubernetes resources like namespaces, services, pods, events, logs and config maps.

Even if most Kubernetes operations can be done using the kubectl CLI, learning the API is the best way for complex use cases and when you want to create an application that interacts with Kubernetes.
